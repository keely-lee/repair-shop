# README
Repair Shop is an app to be used for working with youth dealing with emotional stress as an aid to help them sort their feelings.

## Functionality & MVP

- The home page will be used for navigation depending on the tool needed at that emotional state.
- It will initially start with three to four main components that can eventually be further built upon with different types of activities.
- Each main component will start with one activity, but will be created in a way to add additional activities over time.
- A "battery" will be used as a status bar and completing the activities will charge the battery; depending on the need at the time, the facilitator will determine the types and number of activities needed.
